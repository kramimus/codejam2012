============================

Mark Whitney's unofficial Google code jam answers for the 2012
competition.  I will add my answers for each round I advance to once
the round is over and it is permissible to publish answers.

Qualification Round
-------------------

There is a bug somewhere in my solution to problem C, it did not pass
the large problem set.

I read problem D and decided I didn't want to implement a raytracer so
I did not attempt it.  I also did not even understand how to derive
the solution to the 3rd example case by hand, so I figure I was pretty
much doomed at that point.

I specifically switched to using python3 for this challenge to use the
*-format tuple unpacking in the problem B solution.  I figure it is
good for me anyway.
